# Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-means-Clustering
In this clustering project we applied Machine Leaning Life Cycle. 

1. Firsly we analyzed data and make EDA for understanding data.
2. For clustering we first applied Hieracial Clustering technquie and after that K means clustring is applied. 
3. After Applying Clustring we also used PCA for K means clustring for more analysis. 
4. We divided customer and also we are carried out logistic regression for their purchase prediction from their past data.
5. Also we divied them based and their purchase cluster and make a analyis of them.

Tools and Algortims: 
Machine Learning: Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn using Python
